            <p>Over the years I have done a great deal of work in accessibility. Like most, at first it was learn as you go and figuring out with searches. The basics were covered and used tools like Wave and use of screen readers to help find issues during development.</p>
            <p>As time went by and my career developed, I was pulled more and more into accessibility solutioning, both in code and design. Tools grew and accessibility began to be looked at more critically and careers in the space developed. Because of my interest in this area, and the belief that this is where I can give something back, I decided to get my A11y certifications.</p>
